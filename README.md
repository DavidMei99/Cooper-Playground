## Introduction

We design and build a public event platform that allows groups to create events and users to register as attendees. Its basic functions are shown below:

1. Users can create accounts and any registered user can creat a group and become the administrator of a group.

2. Administrator of a group can create/edit events(time, location, etc.).

3. Users can join any existing group, and administrators can add/delete members from their managed groups.

4. Users can view their attended groups as well as associated events.

5. Users can parpticipate in any event created in their attended groups.
